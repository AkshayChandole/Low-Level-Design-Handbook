Make an object-oriented design for a multi-entrance and exit parking lot system.

## [Problem definition](#problem-definition)
A parking lot is a designated area for parking vehicles, commonly found in venues like shopping malls, sports stadiums, and office buildings. It consists of a fixed number of parking spots allocated for different types of vehicles. Each spot is charged based on the duration a vehicle remains parked. Parking time is tracked using a parking ticket issued at the entrance. Upon exit, the customer can pay using either an automated exit panel or through a parking agent, with a credit/debit card or cash as accepted payment methods.

#### Which design pattern(s) should be used for solving the problem of managing a parking lot efficiently?
  - Singleton: Useful for managing the payment processor and central ticket tracking to ensure only one instance controls critical operations across floors and exits.
  - Strategy: Allows for applying different pricing models based on time parked and vehicle type.
  - Factory Method: Helps create various parking spot and vehicle type objects dynamically without changing client code.
  - Observer (Optional): Can notify parking agents or automated panels when spots become available or full.
  - Proxy (Optional): Can manage access to payment gateways or ticket validation, adding security and caching if needed.
